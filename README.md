Twitterbot Code Final
============

For my Code Final I attempted to do many different things- what I first had in mind was to
create a bot that would tweet back at people who would mention certain hashtags, add the words
in the tweet to a stored "data bank", and use them in conjunction with a markov chain to generate
a completely new tweet. I ran into a lot of difficulties when trying to do this so I decided to 
try something that was a little more feasible. What I decided to do was write code in p5 that using
regex would split each word in two text files in different arrays based on the amount of syllables,
and then randomly generate haikus based off of different combinations of syllables, and would reply 
with these haikus at people who tweeted my bot with a certain hashtag. I unfortunately wasn't able 
to get it all working in time, so in the end I took verses from existing haikus and mashed them up 
using three arrays.
